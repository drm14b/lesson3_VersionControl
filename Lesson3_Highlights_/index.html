            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is when you have many developers all coming together to the same version control server. Team members simply check the files out, give feedback, make changes, and solve new problems, and then check them back in. A key component of version control is that it sovles the problem of file sharing. Instead of having to send and transfer files, a team can now work on a project each from their own indidvual computers, but still colloborate on the ultimate goal. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One huge benefit of the version control system besides just that it sovles file sharing, is that the files cannont be overwritten on the system. Another benefit is that people can simultaneously same files without conflict, which prevents the fear of accidently overwriting and deleting some of your work. Also it allows you to revert back to past versions of a file/project if you need be. Version control also will have backup files so you will not lose your whole project, or even have to start on a new one completely from scratch..</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that handles both small and massive projects with great ability and efficiency. It is fast, as well as very user accessible for the average user. It contains features like cheap local branching, multiple flow workflows, as well as convient staging areas We used it in lesson 3, as it helped combine the cloud 9 server to this one.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is very useful for a variety of different and specific reasons. For example, every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally in their machine. Since everything is local, it is much easier to work off of. There is also no single point of failure, which can allow the processes to run much faster, leading to greater efficiency and design. Finally, Git will also prevent uinentional overwrite of a shared file on a repository, a problem that used to plague many designers and programmers.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There is a couple basic commands that involve Git. The three and most important steps pertraining to these commands are to add, commit and push. Some basic commands include git init, git add -all and git log. These commands all contain "git" infront, then follow with the commands. These commands were used in this project when were were connecting git hub to the terminal in icloud. I found the git commands very useful as well as interesting..</p>
